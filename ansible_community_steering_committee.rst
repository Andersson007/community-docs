New Policy/Proposals & Inclusion Requests:
==========================================

* The Committee uses the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues>`_ to asynchronously discuss with the Community and vote on Community topics in corresponding issues.

* If you want to discuss an idea that can impact the community, collection best practices, inclusion policy, submitted new policy/proposals & new collection inclusion requests or other topics the Committee is responsible for, create a new issue in the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues>`_ as a discussion topic, and it’ll be discussed asynchronously in the issue itself.

* Changes to the inclusion policy and collection requirements are submitted through a new pull request to the `ansible-collections/overview <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview>`_ repository and a corresponding issue containing their rationale is created in the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues>`_ repository.

* New collection inclusion requests are submitted through a new discussion in the `ansible-inclusion <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/new>`_ repository.

Depending on a topic you want to discuss with the Community and the Committee, as you prepare your proposal, please consider the requirements established by:
