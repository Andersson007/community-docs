Finding the right contribution type for you
-------------------------------------------

A contribution to an Open Source project is any good given by an individual or a company to the project.

There are some ideas on how you can contribute:

  - :ref:`Contributing to the codebase<Contributing to codebase>`.
  - :ref:`Contributing to the code developer experience<Contributing to dev exp>`.
  - :ref:`Contributing to the user experience<Contributing to user exp>`.
  - :ref:`Contributing to the community<Contributing to community>`.
  - :ref:`Other kinds of contributions<Other kinds of contributions>`.

Most types of contribution do not require programming skills.

.. _Contributing to codebase:

Contributing to the codebase
----------------------------

Contribution to software itself (its codebase) includes:

  - `Proposing new features <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/reporting_bugs_and_features.html#requesting-a-feature>`_.
  - `Reporting bugs <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/reporting_bugs_and_features.html#reporting-a-bug>`_.
  - Participating in design and implementation of new components in dedicated issues, pull requests, GitHub discussions, and `IRC channels <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#irc-channels>`_.
  - Fixing bugs.
  - Reviewing code.
  - Refactoring code.
  - Improving stability of an existing codebase through improving a `unit <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_collections_testing.html#adding-unit-tests>`_ and `integration <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_collections_testing.html#adding-integration-tests>`_ testing codebase and infrastructure.
  - Maintaining repositories (for example, backporting merged pull requests and releasing).

You can contribute to a codebase even if you do not have programming skills. For example, you can review proposals, test pull requests locally, add integration tests, file bug reports, create feature requests, or provide feedback to programmers in issues and pull requests.

 - `Test a pull request locally guide <test_pr_locally_guide.rst>`_.

 - `Collection releasing guidelines <releasing_collections.rst>`_.

.. _Contributing to dev exp:

Contributing to the code developer experience
---------------------------------------------

Contribution to code developer experience includes sharing experience through `improving code development documentation <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/documentation_contributions.html>`_, writing development guidelines, mentoring and training code contributors.

.. _Contributing to user exp:

Contributing to the user experience
-----------------------------------

Contribution to user experience includes sharing experience about how to use software more efficiently through improving user documentation, writing manuals and books, making videos, courses, and so on.

Examples:

  - `Clarification and updating user documentation. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/documentation_contributions.html>`_
  - Making a presentation for a local `meetup <https://www.meetup.com/topics/ansible/>`_ covering not well-known but useful usage aspects.

.. _Contributing to community:

Contributing to the community
-----------------------------

In a narrow sense, contribution to a community includes:

  - Promoting the project among people.
  - Thinking of and `proposing ideas <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/>`_ about how community processes can be improved.
  
Examples:

  - `Organizing a meetup <https://www.ansible.com/community/events/ansible-meetups>`_.
  - Writing a blog post about benefits and possible drawbacks of the project compared to other similar projects.
  - Making a presentation on another IT community's event showing how the project can be used by that community to solve their issues.
  - `Suggesting <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/>`_ ideas on how the process of decision making can be improved.

In a broader sense, contribution to a community includes the activities mentioned in all the other types of contribution when they imply good interaction between participants or good impact on the community health and growth.

Examples:

  - If you write a guide which significantly reduces a threshold of the first patch, it can lead to increase of a number of code contributors, which is definitely a contribution to the community.
  - `Active participation in IRC / mailing lists / other discussions <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html>`_.
  - Leading a blog or a website dedicated to the project.
  - `Proposing and discussing ideas in the community meetings <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/>`_, voting on proposals.

.. _Other kinds of contributions:

Other kinds of contribution
---------------------------

Any other kinds of active social or material support are considered contributions to the project.
