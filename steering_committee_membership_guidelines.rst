Absence or irregular participation in discussing topics and votes

In case of absence or irregular participation, the involuntarily removal process consists of the following steps:

1. Another Committee member (hereinafter the initiator) contacts the person by email asking if they are still interested in fulfilling their Committee member's duties.
2. If they respond that they are not interested, the initiator asks the person to step down on their own following the :ref:`Voluntarily leaving process<Voluntarily leaving process>`.
3. If there has been no response / stepping down issue created by the person within a reasonable time, the initiator notifies other Committee members about the situation.
4. In case of agreement among the Committee about the need for removal, the initiator provides a draft of a corresponding topic's description to the Committee via email for discussion and approval.

- The topic's title is ``Steering Committee member audit.``. It must not contain the person's name/information.
- The description must not contain or imply any forms of condemnation.
- It must mention that the person has been inactive for an unknown reason for the last N months and that, in accordance to the Steering Committee policies, their place should be freed for another person who can continue their great job.
- The description must mention person's achievements and thanks for their time and effort they spent serving for the Community, Committee, and the Project, and a hope that one day they will come back.

Ansible Community Code of Conduct violations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In case of the `Ansible Community Code of Conduct <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html>`_ violations, the process is the same as above except steps 1-2. Instead:

1. The initiator reports the case to the Committee via email.
2. The Committee discusses the case internally, evaluates its severity, and possible solutions.
3. If the committee concludes that the violation is not severe, it develops a proposal to the person on how the situation can be corrected and further interactions with the Community improved.
4. A Committee representative reaches out to the person with the proposal.
5. The removal process starts if:

- The Committee decided that the severity of the violation excludes a possibility of further membership.
- The person does not respond to the proposal.
- The person explicitly rejects the proposal.

In case of starting the removal process, the topic's description in the reason's part changes correspondingly.
