*******************************
Ansible Collection Creator Path
*******************************

NOTE: This is a rough draft now. Please do not review the wording
that will 100% change.

The purpose of this guide is to give our collection content creators
a consistent overview of the Ansible collection creator journey from

the Ansible community package.

Each paragraph will reflect one step in the path.
